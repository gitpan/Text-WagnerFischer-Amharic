The Text::WagnerFischer::Amharic module is a simple extension to
the Text::WagnerFischer module where the weight function and costs
table are overridden while using the same distance function.

In addition to the original three Wagner-Fischer costs for equity,
insertion, deletion and inequity, seven additional costs are added
for partial equities under Amharic character classes.

The POD documentation breaks on the UTF-8 characters, view the
examples/demo.pl for an understanding of usage.
